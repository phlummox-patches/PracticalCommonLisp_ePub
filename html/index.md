# Practical Common Lisp

that book is dead sexy ---Xach on \#lisp

([more blurbs](blurbs.html))

This page, and the pages it links to, contain text of the Common Lisp
book *Practical Common Lisp* published by Apress These pages now contain
the final text as it appears in the book. If you find errors in these
pages, please send email to <book@gigamonkeys.com>. These pages will
remain online in perpetuity---I hope they will serve as a useful
introduction to Common Lisp for folks who are curious about Lisp but
maybe not yet curious enough to shell out big bucks for a dead-tree book
and a good Common Lisp tutorial for folks who want to get down to real
coding right away. However, don't let that stop you from buying the
printed version available from Apress at your favorite local or online
bookseller. For the complete bookstore browsing experience, you can read
the [letter to the reader](letter-to-reader.html) that appears on the
back cover of the treeware edition of the book.
